## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
[Browser A]  ←──WebSocket──→  [Socket.IO Server]  ←──WebSocket──→  [Browser B]
                                      │
                               [Express REST API]
                                      │
                               [MongoDB Atlas]
```

### How WebSockets Enable Real-Time Sync

1. Every client opens a persistent WebSocket connection via Socket.IO on page load
2. When Host presses Play → `play` event → server validates role → broadcasts `sync_state` to all room members
3. All clients receive `sync_state` and call `player.playVideo()` at the same timestamp
4. No polling. No page refresh. Instant, bidirectional communication.

### Role-Based Logic (Backend)

- Every socket event handler calls `hasPermission(participant)` before processing
- `hasPermission` checks if role is `host` or `moderator` — rejects `participant`
- `assign_role` is exclusively checked for `role === 'host'`
- Roles are stored in MongoDB and re-broadcast after every change
